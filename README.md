This project is part of Front End Development - Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster Scholarship from Udacity. It is the second project that is an extension work from the first one - [JNavey Personal Blog]( https://jsnavey.github.io/JNavey-Personal-Blog/) which focuses only on HTML and CSS. For this project, I implement the knowledge of DOM manipulation to add, remove and check elements in DOM.

# Installation
Installation is not required.

# Usage
As mentioned above, this project is based on the first project's struture. However, I modified some contents in order to fullfill the rubric requirement.

#### 1. Built 4 content sections in HTML file.
There are Home, Trending, Posts and About sections. Home section has an empty navigation menu (empty ul).

#### 2. Create the navigation menu dynamically and add into the empty ul.
Implement `setAttibute()`, `createElement()`, `innerHTML`, `append()`, and `appendChild()`.

#### 3. Add functionality to check if the specific section is being viewed in viewport. If the section is visible, add "Active State".
1. Add `scroll` to `addEventListener()`.
2. Use `forEach` to run each section and check top and height of it.
